  ### Description
  
  Movies Info is an app I designed that helps the user find instant information on any movie they desire. With the help of themoviedb.org's wonderful API, I used axios to fetch
  individual titles and also trending/top rated movies and fill my UI with the information they've provided. Clicking on a movie grants you the movie's description, rating, date
  release, cast, and even a trailer. I Utilized Youtube's API to persue a user's interest of a movie by fetching trailers/teasers. My next step is to add "availability", so that
  a user can know where to buy/rent the film they're interesed in.
